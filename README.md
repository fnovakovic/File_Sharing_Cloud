Concurrent and distributed systems - Final project

files, retrieve files from the system, delete files on the local server, topological organization of the system for faster file retrieval and
failure resistance.

Basic functionalities of the system include:

1. Adding new files to the system.
2. Fetching files that are not present on the node.
3. Deleting files from the system.
